# Assignment 0: Python — Tutorial

This assignment is designed to introduce the core concepts of Python 3 and
ensure that you have the skills required to complete the subsequent
assignments.

Python is an object-oriented, interpreted, garbage collected, dynamically typed
language where white space matters.

## Useful Resources

If you don't know much about Python, check out [this
tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/) for a quick introduction.

Python has a standard [style guide](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/)
called PEP 8, which many people adhere to. You may wish to peruse this to get a
sense of what constitutes good style. The standard style will not be rigorously
enforced, but particularly egregious violations may attract penalties if they
make your code hard to understand.

## Installing Python

This course uses Python 3\. Due to incompatibilities between different major
versions of the language, it is imperative that you develop your assignments
using Python 3 rather than Python 2\. On Linux and OS X, you can check whether
you have Python 3 installed by opening up a terminal and entering `python3 --version`. The command should print something like “Python 3.7.3” to the
screen. It's okay if the minor version is slightly different—the important
thing is that the major version should be Python 3.5 or later.

If you don't have Python already on your computer, we recommend you install
[Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

If you're using a CSIT lab computer, you need to use the `Anaconda3 shell`
to run Python (don't use the built-in terminal). Ask your tutor if you don't
know what this means.

Note for Windows users: Make sure that you install Python in a path that
doesn't contain any spaces (e.g. don't put it in `Program Files`).
